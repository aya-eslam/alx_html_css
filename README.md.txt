# CSS Advanced Project

This project focuses on styling a web page using advanced CSS techniques. The design file is available on Figma, and you can access the final result [here](link_to_figma_page).

## Figma Design

To view the design details, you need to create an account on Figma and "Duplicate to your Drafts". If you don't have the fonts used in the design, you can download them here:
- [Source Sans Pro](link_to_source_sans_pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT](link_to_spin_cycle_ot)

Some values in the design are in float - feel free to round them.

## Project Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing all the styles for the project.
- `images/`: A directory containing all the images used in the project.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/alx_html_css.git
    cd alx_html_css/css_advanced
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the styled page.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary fonts installed to match the design on Figma.
- Feel free to make any relevant changes to the HTML code if needed (e.g., adding images for logos, etc).
